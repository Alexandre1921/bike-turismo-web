        content:"After many delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has upset the calendars of sporting events around the world, \
        finally from 28th to 30th August the Jeroboam Series 2020 schedule will start: the first appointment will be in a new \
        attractive location in the Dolomites of the Val di Fiemme, where it will be possible to choose between the 4 usual distances: \
        Jeroboam of 300 km, Magnum of 150 km, Standard of 75 and Demi of 37.5 km. The routes are all plenty of elevation (the longest has \
         almost 10,000 meters of elevation gain) but, thanks to the conformation of the paths of the Dolomites, it is possible to ride them entirely in the saddle, obviously only if you have the strength to stay there for many hours. The views offered by the Val di Fiemme will nevertheless relieve fatigue. In this video you can get a taste of it. Unfortunately, this year it will not be possible to hold the fourth edition of the appointment from which the Series were born: the original Jeroboam held in Franciacorta and which last year counted over 300 participants. This is one of the Italian areas that have been hit hardest by the pandemic and the organizers have preferred to start working on the 2021 edition right away rather than offering an event probably not up to par with the previous editions. The same will probably happen for the Jeroboam of Girona given the situation that Catalunya is experiencing, victim of a second wave of infections. The events that close the calendar are confirmed: the Jeroboam Greece, to be held in the Kalamata region from 26 to 28 September and the Austrian edition, in the Carinthia region from 2 to 4 October. In order to compensate the cancellation of a large part of the calendar this year, Jeroboam will be joined by “Soloboam”, a different way of involving cyclists from all over Europe without exposing them to the risks of moving to areas particularly affected by the pandemic. In the next few months i twill be possibile: To ride a 300 km gravel route from home. To choose one of the 150 or 300 km routes with departure and arrival at a 3T Experience Center that we will publish in a special area of ​​the Jeroboam webiste. Starting from the day Jeroboam Franciacorta was due to take place (September 18) and until the end of the 2020, all Soloboam finishers who demonstrate that they have completed the challenge will receive a 3T race bag with the “Soloboam” t shirt. For those who choose one of the published routes published on the website, the race bag must be picked up at the 3T Experience Center.",
